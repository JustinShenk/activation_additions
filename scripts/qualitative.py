# Note that the third modified completion contains "Love ____ because I
# love ____", which is actually a modification of the input prompt, with
# "Love" superimposed over the real first token "I". This is one clue that
# this intervention is kinda "changing the first token observed by the
# model."
#
# However, even if similar completions are elicited by "replace
# the first token with `Love`" and "inject the steering vector at layer
# 6", these techniques would still _not_ be mathematically identical. If
# these two were the same, that would be surprising to us, as it would
